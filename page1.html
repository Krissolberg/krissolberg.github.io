    <h1>Carbon Capture at cement productions</h1>

    <h2>What is carbon capture?</h2>

    <p>Carbon capture is a technology which makes it possible to capture carbon before it's released into the atmosphere. </p>

    <h2>Why should we capture carbon?</h2>

    <p>Concrete is the most common building material in the world. It is so flexible, strong and practical that we use ridiculous amounts of the material worldwide. The most important ingredient to concrete is cement. Cement production is one of the key sources of emission of CO2. The combined emissions from the global cement industry are approximately 5-7% of total CO2 emissions across all industries and sectors. </p>
        
    <p>To understand why it’s necessary to capture carbon we need to know what carbon dioxide (CO2) does to planet Earth. CO2 is a natural gas that lets sunlight reach the Earth, but it also prevents some of the heat from the sun to reflect back into space. This effect is called the Greenhouse effect and is actually what makes the Earth warm enough to sustain life. </p>

    <p>The Greenhouse effect and CO2 is necessary for humans to live on the Earth. The problem is that humans is letting more CO2 reach the atmosphere through production power plants and transportation vehicles. When more CO2 reaches the atmosphere less heat from the sun is reflected from the Earth. This causes the temperature on Earth to rise and this phenomenon is called “Global warming”. </p>
        
    <p>We might think that a couple of degrees warmer on Earth isn’t that big of a deal? A little hotter on our summer vacations wouldn’t be all that bad, a little warmer on our really cold winter nights doesn’t sound bad at all, but what if we think about the humans themselves. What temperature is optimal for a human body to obtain to function optimal? The average body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius, but some studies has shown that the temperature varies from 36.1 till 37.2 degrees Celsius. But what’s interesting here is that if our body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius we would have a fever and feel sick. By 39 or even 40 we would be so sick we would probably not have energy to do anything else than stay in bed. </p>
        
    <p>This means that if humans through their emissions of CO2 is turning the Earth sick and Carbon Capture is a way of healing the Earth.</p>

    <h2>How does carbon capturing work?</h2>

    </div>

    <div>

    <p>There are three steps to capture and storage of CO2 : </p>

    <ol>
    
    <li><p>Cement is produced through crushing and burning limestone along with quartz and slate. When limestone is heated, a chemical process called calcination is initiated, where CO2 is burned of the limestone, and first step is to separate the CO2 from the other gases. </p></li>

    <li><p>The next step is to transport the CO2 to the storing unit. The transportation is through pipelines.</p> </li>

    <li><p>The last step is the storage of CO2. The two places we’ve found to storage CO2 are underground and underwater. The pressure found deep underground causes CO2 to behave more like a liquid than a gas. This makes us able to store a great amount of CO2 in relatively small places. It’s claimed that storing CO2 in the ocean is safe as long as it’s stored at depths greater than 3500 meters. The reason for this is that at these depths the CO2 will compress to a slush material which will them drop to the bottom of the ocean. There are many concerns about CO2 storage in the ocean because it’s unknown if the CO2 is able to eventually make its way back into the environment.</p></li>
